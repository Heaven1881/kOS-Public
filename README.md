# kOS-Public
Various useful libraries and scripts for Kerbal Operating System.  Copy scripts to your KSP/Ships/Script folder to use with kOS.  Note that kOS does not look for scripts in subfolders.

If using ssto.ks or deorbit.ks, keep in mind that the scripts and their dependencies use over 10k memory in kOS.  Use the radial kOS chip, or turn the memories to max on the others.
